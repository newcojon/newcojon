- 👋 Hi, I am Jonathan P. Newcomb, Esq.  I am currently training to be a data scientist.  For the past 15 years, I was an trial and appellate attorney.  I have numerous reported decisions, including a number of cases that turned on policy and statutory interpretation arguments, interstate compact law, and subject matter jurisdiction.  
- I went on sabbatical in March 2020, initially to homeschool my children during the Covid pandemic.  While on sabbatical, I became interested in python programming, data science, and machine learning. 
- In February 2022, I began studying data science and python programming at the Flatiron School in New York City.
👀 I am currently looking for a role that will allow me to utilize data science driven evidence to make policy arguments, to employ my data science skills and generate actionable insights for my employer.  
In addition, I am looking for a role to utilize machine learning algorithms 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of all kinds related to the legal industry and data science.
