- 👋 Hi, I am Jonathan P. Newcomb, Esquire and I am currently in training to become a data scientist.  For the past 15 years, I was a highly successful trial and appellate attorney, with a number of reported appellate decisions that turned on issues of policy/statutory interpretation, interstate compact law, and subject matter jurisdiction.  

- I went on sabbatical in March 2020 to homeschool my children during the Covid pandemic; and during this time, I became interested in python programming, data science, and machine learning. 

- In February 2022, I began studying data science and python programming as a student at the Flatiron School in New York City. 

- 👀 I am seeking a role that will allow me to generate actionable insights in connection with legal and regulatory policy, possibly for a large coporate legal department. 

- Specifically, I am seeking a role that will allow me to construct and employ inferential and predictive models including logitstic and linear, as well as machine learning applications. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects of all kinds related to the legal industry.  
- 📫 How to reach me jnewcomb54@gmail.com
