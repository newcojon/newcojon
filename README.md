- 👋 Hi, I’m @newcojon. 
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain applications, natural language processing, and other technology that helps streamline legal processes. In addition, I am interested in the regulation and custody of NFTs and cryptocurrency.  
- 🌱 I’m currently studying at the Flatiron School and have 15 years experience as a practicing attorney.  
- I think most agreements in business can be done with boilerplate language and minimal attorney review, thus, the legal industry should be ripe for more efficient and cost effective applications in most cases.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of all kinds related to the legal industry, blockchain, or Natural Language Processing. 
- 📫 How to reach me jnewcomb54@gmail.com
